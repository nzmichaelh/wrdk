Usage
-----
Prerequisites:
 * A WikiReader
 * A SD card
 * A working build of the wikireader respository
 * A serial port hooked into the debug port on the WikiReader
 * The python-serial library

Preperation:
 * Run 'make'.  This builds stub.app and stub.ico
 * Run 'make install'.  This copies everything needed into a directory
   called 'dist'
 * Copy the contents of 'dist' onto the SD card
 * Insert the SD card into the WikiReader

Using:
 * Turn on the WikiReader.  You should see a 'download' icon appear
 * Run 'python loader.py application-to-load.bin'
 * The program should download and start

You can convert a application from the '.app' format to a plain binary
file using

 c33-epson-elf-objcopy -j .text -j .data -j .rodata -O binary prog.app prog.bin

The loader can also automatically reset the device.  To use this
feature, connect the DSR line to the reset pin on the debug port.
